I'm a Computer Science major/Cybersecurity minor at TAMU seeking a summer internship. My current focus is on cloud security, network security, ethical hacking, and I'm working as a Cybersecurity Apprentice for A&M. I'm seeking to apply my skills to add value and gain experience in a professional setting.
