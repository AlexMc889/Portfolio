I'm a Computer Science major/Cybersecurity minor at TAMU seeking a summer internship. My current focus is on cloud security, network security, ethical hacking, and I'm working as a Cybersecurity Apprentice for A&M. I'm seeking to apply my skills to add value and gain experience in a professional setting. 

## Projects
### IP Reputation Checker in Python 
Python program that is integrated into VirusTotal's API and ipinfo.io's API to retrieve the given IP's location and reputation. It also checks the IP against lists of known VPN and Tor nodes.
