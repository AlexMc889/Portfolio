I'm a Computer Science major/Cybersecurity minor at TAMU seeking a summer internship. My current focus is on cloud security, network security, ethical hacking, and I'm working as a Cybersecurity Apprentice for A&M. I'm seeking to apply my skills to add value and gain experience in a professional setting. 

## Projects
### External IP Connections Analyzer in Python/Bash/Powershell
Python program that is integrated into VirusTotal's API and ipinfo.io's API to retrieve the given IP's location and reputation. It also checks the IP against lists of known VPN and Tor nodes.

Has 2 seperate programs one in bash and one in powershell.

It retrieves all active connections to external IPs using bash and ss command, writes them to a file, then runs them through the python program.

### AWS Cloud Project 
Designed a secure, scalable AWS infrastructure with VPC segmentation using public and private subnets.

Implemented an Application Load Balancer (ALB) and Auto Scaling Group for high availability.

Configured a NAT Gateway for secure outbound traffic and a bastion host for restricted access.

Deployed a Splunk server to monitor logs from EC2 instances and the bastion host.

Conducted simulated attacks to test security monitoring and threat detection.
